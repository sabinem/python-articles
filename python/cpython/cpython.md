# Understanding the forces that drive Python

## About
I recently wanted to understand how Python evolves, where it is heading, how it compares to other languages. This article is what I came up with in trying to answer these questions. 

## Starting point: Talk of Armin Ronacher
The talk that got me on that track is the following by Armin Ronacher, who has been part of Pytho for a long time, but also works with other languages, such as Rust and Javascript. He provided me with a birds eye view on Python, that I was seeking out:

## How Python is driven by CPython
His main point in this talk is that Python is too much oriented towards CPython. Its future is shaped by whatever CPython is able to deliver, even though there are Jython Pypy and some more implementations of Python that have different possibilties.

## How things could be different
He contrasted Python with Javascript where there is a language standard, such as ECMA6 that is constantly evolving and tries to reach aggrements and translations instead of constantly broading the language as it happens in Python.
