# CPython

To understand Python we have to understand where Python comes from.

I found that talk of Armin Rornacher very interesting:

His main point in this talk is that Python is too much oriented towards CPython. Its future is shaped by whatever CPython is able to deliver, even though there are Jython Pypy and some more implementations of Python that have different possibilties.

He contrasted Python with Javascript where there is a language standard, such as ECMA6 that is constantly evolving and tries to reach aggrements and translations instead of constantly broading the language as it happens in Python.
